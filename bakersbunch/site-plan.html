        <strong>The Case of the Ruined Frosting</strong><br /><br />

        This morning, Sparkle discovered that her famous frosting had been
        messed with! Someone added salt instead of sugar — a rookie mistake, but
        a suspicious one.
        <br /><br />

        <strong>Suspects:</strong><br />
        • **Sparkle** — But would she ruin her own masterpiece? • **Chip** —
        Known for getting distracted… and mixing things up. • **Maple** — Calm,
        collected, but was acting strangely this morning.
        <br /><br />

        <strong>Clues You Can Discover:</strong><br />
        • A trail of sugar crystals leading to the pantry • A missing bag of
        salt • A suspiciously clean mixing bowl • A note that reads: “Sorry!” in
        messy handwriting
        <br /><br />
